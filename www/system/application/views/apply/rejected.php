<p>Dear <?php echo htmlspecialchars($user->firstname); ?>,</p>
<p>
  Thank you for your interest in Living Hope and other
  ministries. We regret to inform you that we cannot
  accept your application at this time. There are many
  factors involved in selecting volunteers for our
  ministry in South Africa. Timing, talent, and the
  Lord's direction are just a few. While we want to
  ensure each individual can use their gifts and talents
  to serve the community well, we also seek to provide
  opportunities that will allow each individual to
  grow and learn.
</p>
<p>
  Although this is not the right fit for you, the Lord
  has designed something for you and it is our hope you
  find it a blessing. Please be encouraged in your
  ministry and next steps.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any further questions, please
